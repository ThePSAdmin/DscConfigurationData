PowerShell DSC Configuration Module
===========

Toolkit to Manage DSC configuration Data and Credentials.

This is a refreshed version of Steve Murawski's DscConfiguration module from
[PowerShell.Org repository](https://github.com/PowerShellOrg/DSC/), with the content added by Dave Wyatt
and other contributors.


Project goals
============

The goals are to:
 - Target WMF5 to benefit from the improvement of the latest additions to DSC
 - Re-target the dependencies to the ones managed by the PowerShell Team
 - Improve maintainability by refactoring, completing the test suites and decoupling from other tools/modules
 - Harmonisation of the command names and parameters
 - improving discoverability of the project by documenting and publishing the module
 - Build up on the existing and enhance its functionalities

The Project for the next version is on the [Project page: DscConfiguration v3.0.0](https://github.com/gaelcolas/DscConfiguration/projects/1)
